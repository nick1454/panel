                            is badly affected. Ayurveda has many medicines that work in IBS and digestion related
                            disorders. IBS patients are
                            advised curd by their doctors. As a result these patients start consuming curd a lot, even
                            three times a day. It is seen
                            that curd helps to some extent but does not aim at curing the disease. On the contrary, curd
                            due to its sliminess blocks
                            all the channels of the body and patient ends up in other auto immune disorders like

                        <p>Sinusitis is an inflammation of the paranasal sinuses (air-filled cavities inside the bones of the skull). The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull. They are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. Normal functional sinuses contain no bacteria or other germs, mucus drains out and air is able to flow through the sinuses.Anything interfering with the flow of air into and drainage of mucus out of the sinuses can cause sinusitis, that is when the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up.</p>
